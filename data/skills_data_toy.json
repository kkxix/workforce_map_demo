The goal is to increase this amount in subsequent years. According to the State Broadband Plan, the State government has an inventory of vertical assets available for broadband expansion and the public – private sector partnership has been successful because services to the public can be expanded while providing additional revenues offsetting costs for State government.; \r\nThe State also emphasizes that a business-friendly environment requires that high speed broadband be available wherever the business might be located. The 2019 broadband grant program provides incentives for proposals to include businesses in their build-outs.; \r\n As for the current state of broadband in South Dakota, the State ranks 35th in the country, with an average download speed of 17.38 Mbps, almost half of the average for the fastest State. ;\r\nAccording to the FCC and the 2016 Broadband Deployment Report: (1) 88 percent of South Dakotans have access to 25/3 terrestrial services, (2) 41 percent of South Dakota counties are at 90 percent or above for their population have 25/3 access and (3) Five counties have 100 percent 25/3 access across the county. Brule, Faulk, Hyde, Potter and Sully, and (5) Dewey (1.7 percent), Ziebach (12.1 percent) and Harding (24.6 percent) counties have the least amount of population with broadband access. \r\n ",
