        "State has identified in-demand digital skill needs using Statewide data? ": "yes; The WIOA State Plan notes that “the insurgence of transportation manufacturing in the State has produced a huge demand for highly skilled technical workers. Occupations such as team assemblers, aircraft mechanics, aircraft assemblers, welders, industrial machinery mechanics, computer-controlled machine operators, machinists, and many others have experienced significant increases in employment. Furthermore, advances in technologies, such as the wide use of robotics for parts assembly, have raised the level of skills required to compete for these jobs. This facility, as well as the Alabama Industrial Development Training (AIDT) Maritime training facility in Mobile, are providing invaluable training services to manufacturing employers across the State.” ; “The remaining occupations that occur Statewide in the high demand list are IT occupations, engineers, managers, and various financial and data analyst type occupations. Computer occupations will continue to be in high demand as technology increases the careers that require computers and robotics. In recent years, however, interest in the pursuit of advanced IT careers has waned, so workforce development is working on efforts to increase the number of students trained in this field. The three engineering occupations are all imperative for the success of the State’s thriving manufacturing sector: industrial engineers, mechanical engineers, and aerospace engineers. Demand for market research analysts is a reflection of an emphasis on making effective and efficient decisions based on data analysis. With the advancement of technology, more data is being collected than ever before. Companies are beginning to see the advantages of regular data analysis to increase success.” ; Additionally, The Labor Market Information (LMI) Division began a series of training events throughout the State, focusing on workforce development partners, employers, and two-year colleges to introduce LMI data and how to interpret it.

        "State has additional dedicated digital skills initiatives?": "Yes; The Michigan Industry Cluster Approach (MICA) 2.0 is a demand-driven workforce system in Michigan’s primary workforce development strategy focusing on aligning all efforts, initiatives, programs, and funding around industry clusters. An industry cluster is a geographic concentration of related employers, industry suppliers, and support institutions in a product or service field. MICA’s employer-led collaboratives will develop and implement strategies to develop a qualified pool of talent and address the skill gaps. MICA creates a framework in which many employers within a single industry jointly engage with the workforce system to identify their talent demand and challenges. In this approach, talent issues may be handled more efficiently though multi-company, industry-focused employment and training programs. As industry clusters are established, the focus shifts emphasis on talent issues to an industry basis, rather than working with a single employer at a time. Utilizing the MICA strategy, Talent Development Liaisons (TDL) are assigned a specific industry cluster (i.e. Agriculture, Business, Construction, Energy, Information Technology, Health Care, Hospitality, Manufacturing and Mobility).; The Going PRO Talent Fund (Talent Fund) makes awards to employers to assist in training, developing and retaining newly hired employees. Training funded by the Talent Fund must be short-term and fill a demonstrated talent need experienced by the employer. One of these demonstrated need areas is IT. In 2019, the program awarded $31.7 million in grants.;\r\nMichigan was awarded a Reimagine Workforce Preparation Grant from the U.S. Department of Education for $17 million to build on previous program successes and partnerships, informed by current labor market data, and guided by the ICAs, MiLEAP provides for the rapid, streamlined transition of participants into the demand-driven workforce. The program design is based on existing and proven industry-driven training and education programs in Michigan. This includes the Going PRO Talent Fund (Talent Fund), the Apprenticeship Success Coordinators (ASC) model, and utilization of sector partnerships such as the Michigan Industry Cluster Approach (MICA). ;\r\nTalent Development Liaisons, through the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity – Workforce Development, engage employers and educators statewide to develop employer-led collaboratives to address industry-specific workforce needs with grant awards ranging from $25K to $200K.

These subsectors and concentrations include: IT / software, cyber-physical systems, and data analytics: “As the world transitions into the next phase of the information technology revolution, a range of technologies—including wireless communications, sensing and imaging data, and the Internet of Things—are converging with rising demand for technologies and applications capable of storing, processing, and analyzing large, complex datasets to inform real-time decisions. Specific opportunities for the state include cyber-physical systems and data analytics, autonomous underwater vehicles, remote medical device monitoring systems, environmental and energy monitoring, and smart grid infrastructure.”;\r\nRhode Island seeks to gain or maintain footholds in each of these high growth, high potential industries, subsectors, and concentrations, then work backwards from that demand signal to inform, develop, and reverse engineer pathways into those occupations. Further cementing the workforce development network as a key element within the state’s larger economic development structure, the Strategy portion also includes specific initiatives and priorities that result from, and align with, the Rhode Island Innovates economic analysis. ; For the occupations identified in both the Statewide labor market information and Brookings Rhode Island Innovates report, a majority require high levels of one or more STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields. This suggests that a number of STEM competencies are highly valuable to employers and are associated with jobs with above average growth rates and typically pay a living wage. ;\r\nIrrespective of degree attainment, the Brookings Report found that Rhode Island has lagged in providing specific skills and focusing on areas of discipline most associated with success in the 21st century economy - this may result in a shortage of labor supply for Rhode Island businesses and is particularly acute in computer programming and coding jobs, which have seen thousands of openings each year in Rhode Island.

The WIOA State plan differentiates between hard and soft skills, but does not mention the need for digital skills.;\r\nThe WIOA State plan states “Key takeaways from the survey reinforce the need for middle-level skills.” The State plan identifies a gap between projected worker supply and demand in various occupation fields, including “business and IT services”.;\r\n“The state’s vision is to expand and develop a skilled workforce. To do this, the state will focus on strengthening the workforce pipeline through work-based learning, including apprenticeship, as well as soft skills and the development of career pathways. Technical colleges and CTE schools are key partners in these efforts and have access to additional funding and resources that will enhance access to workforce development programs.\";\r\nThe State Perkins plan recognizes the need for digital skills, noting “ The demands from industry require that we acknowledge the many gains made in business and industry from our past, maintaining the progress of our present, while forging and setting the path of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, augmented reality, blockchain, the Internet of Things, and automation for our future. We must not only train and develop a skilled workforce for the needs of the present industry but also develop divergent thinking, which allows a skilled workforce to be disrupters of global industries and economies by meeting as well as exceeding the needs of consumers in innovative and authentic ways. The ensuing 4th Industrial Revolution that is upon us requires that we do the following:  Redefine the purpose of education;  Improve STEM Education;  Develop Human Capital and Potential;  Adapt to lifelong learning models;  Alter educator training;  Make schools makerspaces;  Develop International Mindfulness; and Redefine and Restructure Higher Education”;\r\nAccording to the State Perkins Plan, “the five priority or high growth industries as identified by the South Carolina stakeholder team are Diversified Manufacturing; Construction; Health Care; Information Technology; and Transportation and Logistics.”;\r\nThe State plan mentions the Help Wanted Online (HWOL) data set, which tracks supply and demand in the labor market.",

The goal is to increase this amount in subsequent years. According to the State Broadband Plan, the State government has an inventory of vertical assets available for broadband expansion and the public – private sector partnership has been successful because services to the public can be expanded while providing additional revenues offsetting costs for State government. ; The State also emphasizes that a business-friendly environment requires that high speed broadband be available wherever the business might be located. The 2019 broadband grant program provides incentives for proposals to include businesses in their build-outs. ; As for the current state of broadband in South Dakota, the State ranks 35th in the country, with an average download speed of 17.38 Mbps, almost half of the average for the fastest State. ; According to the FCC and the 2016 Broadband Deployment Report: (1) 88% of South Dakotans have access to 25/3 terrestrial services, (2) 41% of South Dakota counties are at 90% or above for their population have 25/3 access, (3) Five counties have 100% 25/3 access across the county.

Because the State now has a plan in place, South Dakota companies have been awarded additional points on their applications for USDA Reconnect grants.  This is a federal program that provides funding for telecommunications updates. In December, this federal program awarded another $9.5 million dollars in high-speed broadband infrastructure that will create or improve connectivity for more than 1,750 homes in rural South Dakota. Combined, that means our $5 million dollars has resulted in a $25 million investment in underserved areas – touching 6,500 homes and nearly 150 businesses.” ; The State of the State also highlighted cybersecurity as a rising industry: “One important and emerging sector is cybersecurity. We all know that the threat of a cyber-attack is an increasing concern to individuals, businesses, and governments in every corner of the globe. In May 2019, the Economic Development Administration awarded a $1.46 million-dollar grant to Dakota State University to help establish a high-speed research network. Because it is designated as an Opportunity Zone, the investment will receive a $1.46 million-dollar match in local funds. For the EDA to invest its money into Dakota State is monumental.
