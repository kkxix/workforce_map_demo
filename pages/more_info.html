                                            'skills' per se, but a combination of behaviors, expertise, know-how, work habits, character traits, dispositions and

                                            As laid out by the International Telecommunication Union, Basic Skills are the general ICT skills required "broadly for
                                            all workers, consumers and citizens in a digital society" — such as word processing or researching online. Building on

                                            specialist occupations and professions," are necessary to test, analyze, manage, or create digitally based products or
                                            services. These advance skills are needed to harness technology to resolve complex problems, guide others such as

                                            Skills are the supply side of digital labor markets; jobs are the demand side. Digital or ICT work can be conceived in
                                            three terms: enhanced, dependent, intensive. Some jobs are enhanced by digital tools, whereas with others — such as
                                            Internet freelancing or call centers — technology is fundamental to the work. Digitally intensive work — such as machine
                                            learning or app development — requires more specialist and advanced skills.

                                    point to the need for upskilling the workforce: 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            The window of opportunity to reskill and upskill workers has become shorter in the newly constrained labour market. This
                                            applies to workers who are likely to stay in their roles as well as those who risk losing their roles due to rising
                                            recession-related unemployment and can no longer expect to retrain at work. For those workers set to remain in their
                                            roles, the share of core skills that will change in the next five years is 40%, and 50% of all employees will need
                                            reskilling (up 4%).
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The public sector needs to provide stronger support for reskilling and upskilling for at-risk or displaced workers.
                                            Currently, only 21% of businesses report being able to make use of public funds to support their employees through
                                            reskilling and upskilling. The public sector will need to create incentives for investments in the markets and jobs of
                                            tomorrow; provide stronger safety nets for displaced workers in the midst of job transitions; and to decisively tackle
                                            long-delayed improvements to education and training systems. Additionally, it will be important for governments to
                                            consider the longer-term labour market implications of maintaining, withdrawing or partly continuing the strong COVID-19
