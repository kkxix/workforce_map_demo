                                    point to the need for upskilling the workforce:

                                        <li>
                                            The window of opportunity to reskill and upskill workers has become shorter in the newly constrained labour market. This
                                            applies to workers who are likely to stay in their roles as well as those who risk losing their roles due to rising
                                            recession-related unemployment and can no longer expect to retrain at work. For those workers set to remain in their
                                            roles, the share of core skills that will change in the next five years is 40%, and 50% of all employees will need
                                            reskilling (up 4%).
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The public sector needs to provide stronger support for reskilling and upskilling for at-risk or displaced workers.
                                            Currently, only 21% of businesses report being able to make use of public funds to support their employees through
                                            reskilling and upskilling. The public sector will need to create incentives for investments in the markets and jobs of
                                            tomorrow; provide stronger safety nets for displaced workers in the midst of job transitions; and to decisively tackle
                                            long-delayed improvements to education and training systems. Additionally, it will be important for governments to
                                            consider the longer-term labour market implications of maintaining, withdrawing or partly continuing the strong COVID-19
                                            crisis support they are providing to support wages and maintain jobs in most advanced economies.
